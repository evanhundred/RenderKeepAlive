# How to Use

1. [Import the repository](https://github.com/new/import) to your own GitHub account, using this repo's URL as the old repository's clone URL (recommended to make it public).
2. In your new repo, change the URLs in `sites.json` to the URLs of the websites you wish to keep alive.
3. And... that's it. Depending on where you live, you may want to adjust the times in `.github/workflows/main.yml`
